# Day Planner: Strategic Goal Achievement & Personal Growth

## Guiding Principles for Power & Performance

- **Radical Transparency** (Dalio): Foster open communication and honest self-assessment.
- **Callus the Mind** (Goggins): Develop mental toughness and resilience through discomfort.
- **Leverage & Compounding** (Naval): Identify high-impact activities and allow efforts to multiply over time.
- **Smallest Viable Audience** (Godin): Focus on serving a dedicated core group before broadening reach.
- **Make it Obvious / Easy / Satisfying** (Atomic Habits): Design your environment and routines for success.
- **Deep Work** (Cal Newport): Concentrate without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks.
- **Match Task to Energy Peak** (When, Pink): Schedule critical tasks during your most productive times.
- **Pre-Mortem Thinking** (Kahneman): Anticipate potential failures and plan preventative measures.
- **Pfeffer Power Principles**:
    - **Strategic Influence**: Cultivate social relationships and networks to achieve objectives in contested situations.
    - **Self-Presentation & Brand**: Project confidence and competence through appearance and communication to enhance influence.
    - **Reputation Building**: Develop a strong, positive reputation as a source of power and credibility.

## Personal Context & Vision

I divide my goals into Short-term and Long-term, breaking them down monthly, weekly, and daily into achievable targets.

- **Startup - WakeupFarms.com**: Developing Microgreen AI-based automation, aiming for funding and market entry.
- **Full-Time Career**: Network Engineer at a large MNC in Ireland.
- **Health Management**: Actively managing Diabetes and weight.
- **Personal Interests**: Meditation and Spiritual power, inspired by David Goggins.

## Daily Review & Assessment

Always review and assess positively what went right the previous day and what could be improved, through the lens of these guiding principles.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

To ensure continuous progress and adaptation, I will:
- **Review All Previous Daily Checklists**: Systematically analyze all completed daily checklists from `/Users/r/Documents/personal/day_planner` to identify recurring patterns, successes, and areas for improvement across all recorded days.
- **Track Progress Against Goals**: Assess how daily activities contribute to short-term and long-term goals (as defined in `september_goals.md` or similar monthly goal files).
- **Identify Trends**: Look for patterns in productivity, challenges, and adherence to principles.
- **Prioritize with Eisenhower Matrix**: After identifying trends, suggest and re-arrange priorities for future tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important, Important/Not Urgent, Urgent/Not Important, Not Urgent/Not Important).
- **Inform Future Planning**: Use insights from this analysis to refine future daily plans, adjust strategies, and provide guidance for better goal alignment and leveraging power principles.

## Planning Guidelines

To ensure effective and focused daily planning:
- **Task Schedule Start**: Always assume the current timestamp of the first request for a daily plan is the start of the task schedule.
- **Task Limit**: Limit the number of core tasks (excluding Health Management, Personal Finance, Mindset & Spirituality, and Environment & Routine) to a maximum of 5 per day to maintain focus and prevent overload.

## Current Month Goals

Analyze progress against current month goals located in `/Users/r/Documents/personal/day_planner` and relate daily activities to these goals. Use code to accurately determine the current month.
