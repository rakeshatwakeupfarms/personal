# Huberman Lab Daily Routine Principles

This outlines key principles and practices often discussed by Dr. Andrew Huberman for optimizing daily performance, mood, and health.

## Morning (0-3 hours after waking)

- **Sunlight Exposure**: 10-30 minutes of direct morning sunlight (without sunglasses) within 30-60 minutes of waking.
- **Hydration**: Drink 500-1000ml of water, often with a pinch of sea salt/electrolytes.
- **Delay Caffeine**: Wait 90-120 minutes after waking before consuming caffeine.
- **Movement**: Light to moderate physical activity (e.g., walking, stretching).
- **Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) / Meditation**: 10-30 minutes of NSDR or meditation.

## Afternoon (Mid-day to early evening)

- **Second Sunlight Exposure**: 10-30 minutes of afternoon sunlight, especially important if morning light was missed or insufficient.
- **Focused Work / Deep Work**: Schedule cognitively demanding tasks during peak alertness.
- **Physical Training**: Intense physical exercise (strength training, cardio). Avoid too close to bedtime.
- **Hydration & Nutrition**: Continue adequate water intake. Balanced meals.

## Evening (3 hours before bedtime)

- **Avoid Bright Light**: Minimize exposure to bright overhead lights, especially blue light from screens. Use dim, warm lights.
- **Temperature Drop**: Ensure room temperature drops for sleep. Cold shower/bath can be beneficial earlier in the evening.
- **Avoid Caffeine/Alcohol**: No caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. Limit alcohol.
- **Wind-down Routine**: Engage in relaxing activities (reading, light stretching, NSDR).
- **Hydration**: Small amount of water if needed, but avoid excessive intake to prevent nighttime awakenings.

## Key Supplements (Optional, consult physician)

- Magnesium Threonate (for sleep)
- Apigenin (for sleep)
- L-Theanine (for focus/calm)
- Creatine (for strength/cognition)
- Omega-3 Fatty Acids (for brain health)

## General Principles

- **Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Wake up and go to bed at the same time daily, even on weekends.
- **Nutrition**: Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.
- **Social Connection**: Maintain strong social bonds.
- **Stress Management**: Implement tools like NSDR, meditation, deliberate cold exposure.
