# Saturday Checklist ‚úîÔ∏è

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering
- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Good progress with EVPN lab (vxlan static flood list) and container lab setup. This aligns well with the monthly goal.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: No explicit progress noted in daily checklists.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: No explicit progress noted in daily checklists.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: No explicit progress noted in daily checklists.
- **Overall**: Good progress on practical EVPN, but documentation and DRCC related goals need more focused attention.

### Personal Health and Spiritual
- **Walking Aim for 20k steps**: Consistently missed the 20k steps goal (11k, 12k achieved). Body strain and lack of early morning routine are contributing factors. This goal requires more consistent effort.
- **Meditation - 1 hour blocks**: Consistently missed meditation. This goal needs dedicated scheduling.
- **Spiritual - Candle lights and prayer**: Consistently missed spiritual practice. This goal needs dedicated scheduling.
- **Overall**: Significant gaps in achieving health and spiritual goals, often due to lack of preparation, distractions, or fatigue. These are critical areas for improvement.

### Family and Friends
- **Send token gifts to Wife and Kid**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Speak to friends and get in touch with them (list friends)**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Overall**: No progress on these goals.

- **Butterfly gameday progress**: No explicit progress noted.
- **NOCturnal documentation**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Onboarding Cline and refining it further**: Strong progress on AI usage and agentic write-ups, which directly supports refining Cline and agentic workflows. Mentoring new grads also aligns with professional development.
- **Overall**: Good progress on AI/Cline refinement and Butterfly projects. Documentation and gameday progress need more focus.

### Wakeupfarms Startup and Youtube Goals
- **Migrate step functions**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Close existing AWS account**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Write agentic workflows for retry**: Strong progress on agentic write-ups.
- **Start teaching on youtube in Telugu**: Identified as a new plan for presence, aligning with this goal.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Consolidated Insights (2025-09-11 to 2025-09-12):
- **Consistent Successes**: Strong and consistent engagement with AI/agentic workflows, leading to efficiency gains in both startup and full-time roles. Regular personal finance tracking (coffee fund, ledger). Positive social interactions (mentoring, helping colleagues). Progress in Network Engineering labs (EVPN, container lab setup).
- **Recurring Areas for Improvement**:
    - **Health Management**: Consistently missing 20k steps goal (often due to body strain/fatigue), inconsistent self-energization, missed upper body workouts (lack of prep/attire), issues with CGM (expired), occasional high carb cravings (pizza), inconsistent water intake.
    - **Mindset & Spirituality**: Frequent misses on meditation, spiritual practice (candles/prayer), and evening journal (distractions like movies).
    - **Environment & Routine**: Occasional misses on inbox/desktop declutter and scheduling garden walks.
    - **Preparation**: Lack of preparation for gym attire, early morning routines.
- **Key Trends**: AI usage is a significant and compounding leverage point for productivity. Health and spiritual practices are crucial for overall performance but are often the first to be neglected when under strain or distracted. The conflict with the office manager highlights a need for consistent application of Pfeffer's Strategic Influence principles. Early morning routine is critical for health/spiritual goals.
- **Alignment**: Startup and Network Engineering goals show consistent progress. Health and Spiritual goals need more deliberate planning, consistent effort, and better integration into the daily routine, with improved preparation to overcome recurring challenges.
