# Tuesday Checklist ‚úîÔ∏è

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering

- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Consistent progress on EVPN lab setup. Today's tasks, "Spend on butterfly project 1 hour sync," "Identify and update critical project blockers 15m," "Make a list of blockers in the NBQ Page 15m," and "Work on EVPN Lab setup 1hour," directly contribute to this goal.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: No explicit progress noted in previous daily checklists.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: Meeting scheduled yesterday.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: No explicit progress noted in previous daily checklists.
- **Overall**: Strong focus on Butterfly project and EVPN lab today. NRE and CFAB still need focused attention.

### Personal Health and Spiritual

- **Walking Aim for 20k steps**: Consistently missed the 20k/15k steps goal. Today's task is "walk 10k steps," a more achievable target.
- **Meditation - 1 hour blocks**: Inconsistent, but meditation was done yesterday.
- **Spiritual - Candle lights and prayer**: Inconsistent, but completed on Saturday.
- **Overall**: Health and spiritual practices need consistent effort. The reduced walking goal might help build consistency.

### Family and Friends

- **Send token gifts to Wife and Kid**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Speak to friends and get in touch with them (list friends)**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Overall**: No progress on these goals.

### Office Work

- **Butterfly project continuation and Documentation**: Progressed with Butterfly projects. Today's tasks, "Spend on butterfly project 1 hour sync," "Identify and update critical project blockers 15m," and "Make a list of blockers in the NBQ Page 15m," directly contribute.
- **Butterfly gameday progress**: Tasks today will help identify blockers for gameday.
- **NOCturnal documentation**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Onboarding Cline and refining it further**: Strong progress on AI usage and agentic write-ups. Today's tasks, "Work on Cline workflows 1hour" and "AI Agentic workforce setup 1 hour," directly contribute.
- **Overall**: Strong focus on Butterfly project, Cline, and AI agentic workflows today. NOCturnal documentation still needs attention.

### Wakeupfarms Startup and Youtube Goals

- **Migrate step functions**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Close existing AWS account**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Write agentic workflows for retry**: Strong progress on agentic write-ups and planning a YouTube video. Today's tasks, "Work on Cline workflows 1hour" and "AI Agentic workforce setup 1 hour," directly contribute.
- **Start teaching on youtube in Telugu**: Plan done for YouTube video.
- **Overall**: Good progress on agentic workflows and YouTube planning. Step functions migration and AWS account closure need attention.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Consolidated Insights (2025-09-11 to 2025-09-15):

- **Consistent Successes**: Strong and consistent engagement with AI/agentic workflows, leading to efficiency gains in both startup and full-time roles. Regular personal finance tracking (coffee fund, ledger) when at home. Positive social interactions (mentoring, helping colleagues). Progress in Network Engineering labs (EVPN, container lab setup).
- **Recurring Areas for Improvement**:
  - **Health Management**: Consistently missing 20k/15k steps goal (often due to body strain/fatigue, rain), inconsistent self-energization, missed upper body workouts (lack of prep/attire), issues with CGM (expired), occasional high carb cravings (pizza), inconsistent water intake. Eating habits have been off.
  - **Mindset & Spirituality**: Frequent misses on meditation, spiritual practice (candles/prayer), and evening journal (distractions like movies). While meditation was attempted for 90 mins on 14th, consistency is key.
  - **Preparation**: Lack of preparation for gym attire, early morning routines.
  - **Documentation**: Several monthly goals related to documentation (NRE, DRCC, Nocturnal) have seen limited explicit progress.
- **Key Trends**: AI usage is a significant and compounding leverage point for productivity. Health and spiritual practices are crucial for overall performance but are often the first to be neglected when under strain, distracted, or due to external factors (weather). The conflict with the office manager highlights a need for consistent application of Pfeffer's Strategic Influence principles. Early morning routine is critical for health/spiritual goals.
- **Alignment**: Startup and Network Engineering goals show consistent progress, especially with AI integration. Health and Spiritual goals need more deliberate planning, consistent effort, and better integration into the daily routine, with improved preparation to overcome recurring challenges. Today's tasks directly address several documentation gaps.

### Huberman Routine Adherence & Suggestions

- **Consistent morning sunlight exposure (10-30 min)**: Had AG1 and sat in front of Sunlight.
- **Hydration upon waking (500-1000ml water with electrolytes)**: Had 500ml of of AG1 multivitamin drink
- **Delay caffeine intake (90-120 min after waking)**: NA
- **Incorporate NSDR/Meditation daily (10-30 min)**: Meditation was done yesterday. Aim for consistency and the recommended duration.
- **Optimize evening light exposure (minimize blue light 3 hours before bed)**: Not explicitly noted. Suggest incorporating this into the evening routine.
- **Maintain consistent sleep schedule**: Not explicitly noted. Important for overall energy.
- **Integrate deliberate cold exposure (e.g., cold showers)**: Not explicitly noted. Consider adding this for mental toughness.
