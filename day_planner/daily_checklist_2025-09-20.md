# Friday Checklist ‚úîÔ∏è

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering

- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Consistent, strong progress on EVPN labs and container setup. Blockers for Butterfly project identified and being addressed.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: This remains a consistent gap across all reviewed checklists. Critical need for a skeleton document.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: Meeting scheduled (Sept 15). Follow up on outcomes.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: Remains unaddressed - needs planning.

### Personal Health and Spiritual

- **Walking Aim for 20k steps**: Consistently missed 20k/15k steps goal. Adapted to 10k (Sept 16), which was achieved. Today's plan aims for 15k steps with structured sessions.
- **Meditation - 1 hour blocks**: Inconsistent adherence. Today's plan sets a 30-min minimum with optional extension.
- **Spiritual - Candle lights and prayer**: Sporadic. Integrate into evening routine.
- **Huberman Routine Integration**: Major opportunity for performance enhancement through consistent morning and evening protocols.
- **Health Management (General)**: Recurring issues with CGM, occasional high carb cravings, inconsistent water intake, lack of preparation for gym attire.

### Wakeupfarms Startup and Youtube Goals

- **Agentic Workflows**: Significant strides in AI agentic workflows, including deployment, research on persistence, and planning next steps. This is a high-leverage activity.
- **Migrate step functions / Close existing AWS account**: These foundational tasks have not seen consistent progress and risk becoming blockers. AWS migration prep was documented (Sept 17).
- **Start teaching on youtube in Telugu**: Plan done (Sept 13), but execution has not yet begun.

### Home Cleaning / Minimalism

- **Bathroom cleaning**: Completed (Sept 13).
- **Throw away items**: 3 items discarded (Sept 14). Continue progress toward 17 items by month end.
- **Systematic cleaning**: Backyard cleaning aligns with home environment goal. Dishwasher loading is a recurring task.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Key Insights from Previous Week Analysis (Sept 11 - Sept 18):

- **Highest Leverage**: AI agent development consistently yields compounding returns across both startup and career. You are actively building, deploying, and researching agents.
- **Foundation Gap**: Health routines (morning protocol, hydration, meditation, consistent movement) directly impact energy and performance. Inconsistency is a major blocker, often due to fatigue, cravings, or lack of preparation.
- **Strategic Blind Spot**: Documentation tasks (NRE Packet flow, NOCturnal) are repeatedly deferred despite being critical for knowledge sharing and reputation building.
- **Strategic Startup Tasks**: Foundational tasks like AWS migration and YouTube content creation are planned but execution is inconsistent.
- **Evening Disruption**: Distractions (movies, YouTube shorts) often replace evening journaling and spiritual practices.
- **Pfeffer Principles**: Active application of Strategic Influence (mentoring, project syncs, confronting manager diplomatically), Self-Presentation & Brand (AI demos, professional interactions), and Reputation Building (documentation, lab work, public sharing).

### Huberman Routine Adherence & Suggestions

- **Consistent morning sunlight exposure (10-30 min)**: Inconsistent. Make this a non-negotiable first step.
- **Hydration upon waking (500-1000ml water with electrolytes)**: Inconsistent. Make this an immediate habit upon waking.
- **Delay caffeine intake (90-120 min after waking)**: Not consistently tracked. Consider noting when you have your first coffee.
- **Incorporate NSDR/Meditation daily (10-30 min)**: Inconsistent. Aim for a consistent time and duration.
- **Optimize evening light exposure (minimize blue light 3 hours before bed)**: Not explicitly noted. Incorporate into evening routine.
- **Maintain consistent sleep schedule**: Not explicitly noted. Crucial for overall energy and focus.
- **Integrate deliberate cold exposure (e.g., cold showers)**: Not explicitly noted. Consider adding for mental toughness.

## Pre-Mortem Risk Assessment

**Potential Failure Points:**

- Morning routine disruption if glucose check/AG1 prep not set up night before
- Walking sessions skipped if not calendar-blocked with specific routes planned
- Evening spiritual practice replaced by screen time if not environment prepared (candles, journal ready)
- AI coding session ineffective without clear technical objectives defined

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Set up morning health supplies before bed
- Block calendar for all three walking sessions with specific routes
- Prepare evening spiritual environment by 20:00
- Define specific AI coding objectives in morning review

## One-Sentence Mantra

**"Execute high-leverage technical work with systematic consistency, building influence through documentation and thought leadership."**

Stay relentless.
