# Thursday Checklist ‚úîÔ∏è

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering
- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Consistent, strong progress on EVPN labs and container setup (Sept 11, 12, 15, 16, 17). Identifying blockers for Butterfly project (Sept 16, 17). This goal is being actively pursued.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: This remains a consistent gap across all reviewed checklists. No explicit progress noted.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: Meeting scheduled (Sept 15). This is a good first step.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: No explicit progress noted.

### Personal Health and Spiritual
- **Walking Aim for 20k steps**: Consistently missed the 20k/15k steps goal (Sept 11, 12, 13, 15). Adjusted to 10k (Sept 16), which was achieved. On Sept 17, did not workout. This shows a positive adaptation to build consistency, but needs more consistent execution.
- **Meditation - 1 hour blocks**: Inconsistent adherence (missed Sept 11, 12; completed 1 hour Sept 13; attempted 90 mins Sept 14; 60 mins Sept 16; 30 mins Sept 17). Consistency is a key challenge.
- **Spiritual - Candle lights and prayer**: Sporadic (missed Sept 11, 12; completed Sept 13, 17).
- **Health Management (General)**: Recurring issues with CGM (expired Sept 12), occasional high carb cravings (Sept 11, 12, 17), inconsistent water intake (Sept 12). Prep for gym attire was a blocker (Sept 12).

### Office Work
- **Butterfly project continuation and Documentation**: Good progress on Butterfly projects (Sept 12, 15, 16, 17), including identifying blockers and syncing with the team.
- **Butterfly gameday progress**: Blockers identified (Sept 16).
- **NOCturnal documentation**: This is a recurring gap across all reviewed checklists.
- **Onboarding Cline and refining it further**: Strong, consistent progress on AI usage and agentic workflows (Sept 11, 12, 15, 16, 17). Mentoring new grads (Sept 12) also aligns.

### Wakeupfarms Startup and Youtube Goals
- **Agentic Workflows**: Significant strides in AI agentic workflows (Sept 11, 12, 15, 16, 17), including deployment and planning next steps. This is a high-leverage activity.
- **Migrate step functions / Close existing AWS account**: These foundational tasks have not seen consistent progress and risk becoming blockers.
- **Start teaching on youtube in Telugu**: Plan done (Sept 13), but execution has not yet begun.

### Family and Friends
- **Send token gifts to Wife and Kid**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Speak to friends and get in touch with them (list friends)**: No explicit progress noted.

### Home Cleaning / Minimalism
- **Bathroom cleaning**: Completed (Sept 13).
- **Throw away items**: 3 items discarded (Sept 14). This aligns with the monthly minimalism goal.
- **Dishwasher**: Loaded on Sept 17.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Consolidated Insights (2025-09-11 to 2025-09-17):
- **Consistent Successes**:
    - **AI/Agentic Workflows**: Your most significant leverage point, consistently yielding efficiency gains in both startup and full-time roles. You are actively building and deploying agents.
    - **Network Engineering Labs**: Consistent hands-on progress with EVPN and container lab setups.
    - **Financial Discipline**: Regular personal finance tracking (coffee fund, ledger) when at home.
    - **Mentoring/Social Influence**: Positive interactions like mentoring new grads and helping colleagues.
    - **Minimalism**: Initial steps taken towards the monthly goal.
- **Recurring Areas for Improvement**:
    - **Health Consistency**: While you've adapted the walking goal, overall health practices (meditation, spiritual practice, consistent water intake, glucose monitoring, meal prep, upper body workouts) are inconsistent. Fatigue, cravings, and lack of preparation are common blockers.
    - **Documentation Gap**: Critical documentation tasks (NRE Packet flow, NOCturnal) are consistently being deferred. This is a significant risk for knowledge sharing and project success.
    - **Strategic Startup Tasks**: Foundational tasks like AWS migration and YouTube content creation are planned but not executed.
    - **Evening Routine**: Distractions (movies, scrolling YouTube shorts) often replace evening journaling and spiritual practices.
    - **Preparation**: Lack of preparation for gym attire and early morning routines.
- **Key Trends**:
    - **Leverage AI**: You are effectively leveraging AI for productivity, which is compounding your efforts.
    - **Health as Foundation**: Inconsistent health and spiritual practices directly impact overall performance and resilience. Making these "obvious, easy, satisfying" is crucial.
    - **Pfeffer Principles**: The conflict with the office manager (Sept 12 reflection) highlights the ongoing need to apply Strategic Influence. Your mentoring and documentation efforts contribute to Reputation Building and Self-Presentation.
    - **Early Morning Routine**: Critical for setting the tone for health/spiritual goals.
- **Alignment**: Your daily activities are strongly aligned with Network Engineering and Startup goals, particularly in hands-on development and AI. The primary opportunity lies in building consistency in health and spiritual practices, and dedicating focused time to the important-but-not-urgent documentation and strategic startup tasks.

### Huberman Routine Adherence & Suggestions
- **Consistent morning sunlight exposure (10-30 min)**: Not consistently noted, often impacted by late starts. Make this a non-negotiable first step.
- **Hydration upon waking (500-1000ml water with electrolytes)**: Sometimes noted (AG1 on Sept 15, 16, 17), but not consistent. Make this an immediate habit upon waking.
- **Delay caffeine intake (90-120 min after waking)**: Not consistently tracked. Consider noting when you have your first coffee to assess adherence.
- **Incorporate NSDR/Meditation daily (10-30 min)**: Inconsistent. Aim for a consistent time and duration, even if shorter initially, to build the habit.
- **Optimize evening light exposure (minimize blue light 3 hours before bed)**: Not explicitly noted. This is a major lever for sleep quality and energy. Incorporate into evening routine.
- **Maintain consistent sleep schedule**: Not explicitly noted. Crucial for overall energy and focus.
- **Integrate deliberate cold exposure (e.g., cold showers)**: Not explicitly noted. Consider adding this for mental toughness and resilience.
