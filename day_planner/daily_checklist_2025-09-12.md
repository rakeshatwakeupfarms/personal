## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment


My Reflection : What I understood is that at the start of the day coffee shop opens at 8 am and i get tempeted to go into the shop and do my routine day planning and all. That is not a bad idea as such but if i have to get early day working like strectching, self energisation exercise, bath and also walking i need to get up at 5:30 am to check all these boxes. Also i have to be prepared well to do gym at office like attire and stuff, i assumed no one would be there but in reality there were people yesterday. i Could get a almost 5k walk with 11k steps yesterday but i wanted more. My focus on writing office stuff AI is compounding but it can still improve. I had a argument with the office manager, i tried to stay cool but he has this habit of gas lighting people, i report directly to director so Am playing it nice but it feels bad that wrong people have power, they do not understand the complexity of the project nor they work for a team vision. From Monday onwards I have scheduled a session with Banglore new folks who are fresh grads for onbarding them slowly into networking, I love mentoring people. 


### From 2025-09-11:
- **Successes**: Improved AI usage for work summarization, completed EVPN lab (vxlan static flood list), successfully interviewed a candidate, consistent water intake, managed personal finance (coffee, ledger).
- **Areas for Improvement**: Missed 20k steps goal due to body strain, had high carb craving (ate rice), missed 1 hour meditation, missed spiritual practice (candles, prayer), missed evening journal (watched movie instead).
- **Trends**: Need to prioritize health and spiritual practices more consistently, especially when feeling strained or having cravings. AI usage is a significant leverage point.
- **Alignment**: Daily activities are generally aligned with Network Engineering and Startup goals. Health and Spiritual goals require more consistent effort and better integration into the daily routine, especially during periods of fatigue or stress.
