## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### From 2025-09-11:
- **Successes**: Improved AI usage for work summarization, completed EVPN lab (vxlan static flood list), successfully interviewed a candidate, consistent water intake, managed personal finance (coffee, ledger).
- **Areas for Improvement**: Missed 20k steps goal due to body strain, had high carb craving (ate rice), missed 1 hour meditation, missed spiritual practice (candles, prayer), missed evening journal (watched movie instead).
- **Trends**: Need to prioritize health and spiritual practices more consistently, especially when feeling strained or having cravings. AI usage is a significant leverage point.
- **Alignment**: Daily activities are generally aligned with Network Engineering and Startup goals. Health and Spiritual goals require more consistent effort and better integration into the daily routine, especially during periods of fatigue or stress.
