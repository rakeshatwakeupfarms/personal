# Monday Checklist ‚úîÔ∏è

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering

- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Good progress with EVPN lab (vxlan static flood list) and container lab setup. Today's task includes "Butterfly documentation and improvement, list out some of the blockers," which directly contributes to this goal.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: No explicit progress noted in previous daily checklists.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: Today's task, "Schedule a meeting with IDC DRCC folks on intro and next steps for every Monday," directly addresses this goal.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: No explicit progress noted in previous daily checklists.
- **Overall**: Good practical progress on EVPN. Today's tasks will initiate progress on Butterfly documentation and DRCC understanding. NRE and CFAB still need focused attention.

### Personal Health and Spiritual

- **Walking Aim for 20k steps**: Consistently missed the 20k steps goal (9k-12k achieved). Today, "Walking for 15k steps should be compulsory."
- **Meditation - 1 hour blocks**: Frequently missed, but 90 minutes of "attempted meditation" was noted yesterday. Today, "meditation... as usual."
- **Spiritual - Candle lights and prayer**: Frequently missed, but completed on Saturday. Today, "prayer... as usual."
- **Overall**: Inconsistent adherence to walking, meditation, and spiritual practices. Today's plan emphasizes making these compulsory and consistent. Eating habits need to return to normal.

### Family and Friends

- **Send token gifts to Wife and Kid**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Speak to friends and get in touch with them (list friends)**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Overall**: No progress on these goals.

### Office Work

- **Butterfly project continuation and Documentation**: Progressed with Butterfly projects. Today's task, "Work on some butterfly documentation and improvement, list out some of the blockers," directly contributes.
- **Butterfly gameday progress**: No explicit progress noted.
- **NOCturnal documentation**: No explicit progress noted. Today's task, "Work on Nocturnal project trends," will contribute.
- **Onboarding Cline and refining it further**: Strong progress on AI usage and agentic write-ups. Today's task, "Work on improving documentation for Cline onboarding," directly contributes.
- **Overall**: Good progress on AI/Cline refinement and Butterfly projects. Today's tasks will drive documentation for Butterfly, Cline onboarding, and Nocturnal trends.

### Wakeupfarms Startup and Youtube Goals

- **Migrate step functions**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Close existing AWS account**: No explicit progress noted.
- **Write agentic workflows for retry**: Strong progress on agentic write-ups and planning a YouTube video.
- **Start teaching on youtube in Telugu**: Plan done for YouTube video.
- **Overall**: Good progress on agentic workflows and YouTube planning. Step functions migration and AWS account closure need attention.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Consolidated Insights (2025-09-11 to 2025-09-14):

- **Consistent Successes**: Strong and consistent engagement with AI/agentic workflows, leading to efficiency gains in both startup and full-time roles. Regular personal finance tracking (coffee fund, ledger) when at home. Positive social interactions (mentoring, helping colleagues). Progress in Network Engineering labs (EVPN, container lab setup).
- **Recurring Areas for Improvement**:
  - **Health Management**: Consistently missing 20k steps goal (often due to body strain/fatigue, rain), inconsistent self-energization, missed upper body workouts (lack of prep/attire), issues with CGM (expired), occasional high carb cravings (pizza), inconsistent water intake. Eating habits have been off.
  - **Mindset & Spirituality**: Frequent misses on meditation, spiritual practice (candles/prayer), and evening journal (distractions like movies). While meditation was attempted for 90 mins yesterday, consistency is key.
  - **Preparation**: Lack of preparation for gym attire, early morning routines.
  - **Documentation**: Several monthly goals related to documentation (NRE, DRCC, Nocturnal) have seen limited explicit progress.
- **Key Trends**: AI usage is a significant and compounding leverage point for productivity. Health and spiritual practices are crucial for overall performance but are often the first to be neglected when under strain, distracted, or due to external factors (weather). The conflict with the office manager highlights a need for consistent application of Pfeffer's Strategic Influence principles. Early morning routine is critical for health/spiritual goals.
- **Alignment**: Startup and Network Engineering goals show consistent progress, especially with AI integration. Health and Spiritual goals need more deliberate planning, consistent effort, and better integration into the daily routine, with improved preparation to overcome recurring challenges. Today's tasks directly address several documentation gaps.

### Huberman Routine Adherence & Suggestions

- **Consistent morning sunlight exposure (10-30 min)**: Not consistently noted. Suggest making this a conscious effort upon waking.
- **Hydration upon waking (500-1000ml water with electrolytes)**: Not consistently noted. Today's plan includes AG1, which helps with hydration.
- **Delay caffeine intake (90-120 min after waking)**: Not consistently noted. Consider tracking this.
- **Incorporate NSDR/Meditation daily (10-30 min)**: Meditation is "as usual" today, which is good. Aim for consistency and the recommended duration.
- **Optimize evening light exposure (minimize blue light 3 hours before bed)**: Not explicitly noted. Suggest incorporating this into the evening routine.
- **Maintain consistent sleep schedule**: Not explicitly noted. Important for overall energy.
- **Integrate deliberate cold exposure (e.g., cold showers)**: Not explicitly noted. Consider adding this for mental toughness.
