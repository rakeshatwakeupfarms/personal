# Sunday Checklist ‚úîÔ∏è

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering
- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Consistent, strong progress on EVPN labs and container setup. Identifying blockers for the Butterfly project is also a positive step. This goal is being actively pursued.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: This remains a consistent gap across all reviewed checklists. No explicit progress noted. This is a critical area to focus on next week.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: A meeting has been scheduled, which is a good first step.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: No explicit progress noted.

### Personal Health and Spiritual
- **Walking Aim for 20k steps**: You've adapted by reducing the goal to 10k steps, which has improved consistency. However, it's still an area that requires daily focus.
- **Meditation - 1 hour blocks**: Adherence is inconsistent. Building a consistent daily habit, even if for a shorter duration, is key.
- **Spiritual - Candle lights and prayer**: This is sporadic. Linking it to a specific time or existing habit (like the evening journal) might help.

### Office Work
- **Butterfly project continuation and Documentation**: Good progress on Butterfly projects, including identifying blockers and syncing with the team.
- **NOCturnal documentation**: This is a recurring gap.
- **Onboarding Cline and refining it further**: Strong, consistent progress on AI usage and agentic workflows.

### Wakeupfarms Startup and Youtube Goals
- **Agentic Workflows**: Significant strides in AI agentic workflows. This is a high-leverage activity.
- **Migrate step functions / Close existing AWS account**: These foundational tasks have not seen consistent progress and risk becoming blockers.
- **Start teaching on youtube in Telugu**: The plan is done, but execution has not yet begun.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Consolidated Insights (2025-09-11 to 2025-09-18):

    - **Strategic Startup Tasks**: Foundational tasks like AWS migration and YouTube content creation are planned but not executed.
- **Key Trends**:
    - **Leverage AI**: You are effectively leveraging AI for productivity.
    - **Health as Foundation**: Inconsistent health and spiritual practices impact overall performance.
    - **Pfeffer Principles**: You are actively applying these principles, especially in navigating workplace dynamics.

### Huberman Routine Adherence & Suggestions
- **Morning Sunlight & Hydration**: Make this a non-negotiable first step upon waking.
- **Consistent Meditation**: Aim for a consistent time and duration, even if shorter initially, to build the habit.
- **Optimize Evening Light**: This is a major lever for sleep quality and energy. Incorporate minimizing blue light into your evening routine.
