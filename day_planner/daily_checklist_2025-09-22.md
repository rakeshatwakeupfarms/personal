# Monday Checklist ✔️

## Current Month Goals - Progress Analysis

### Network Engineering

- **Evpn and Butterfly Topology Replication**: Consistent progress. The MPLS reading scheduled for today will further strengthen your core networking knowledge.
- **NRE Packet flow and Documentation**: This remains a critical gap. It's important to schedule a dedicated block of time for this soon.
- **DRCC Gateway policies and understanding**: A meeting has been scheduled. Follow-up is key.
- **DRCC CFAB Block understanding**: No explicit progress noted.

### Personal Health and Spiritual

- **Walking**: The plan for two 30-minute walks today is a great step towards consistency.
- **Meditation & Prayer**: Candle light prayer is scheduled. It's important to also schedule meditation to maintain momentum.
- **Huberman Routine**: Continue to focus on morning sunlight, hydration, and delayed caffeine intake.

### WakeupFarms Startup and Youtube Goals

- **Agentic Workflows**: The multi-agent systems task for today continues your strong progress in this area.
- **Strategic Tasks**: Foundational tasks like AWS migration and YouTube content creation need to be prioritized and scheduled.

## Daily Pattern Analysis & Goal Alignment

### Consolidated Insights (2025-09-11 to 2025-09-21):

- **AI as a Force Multiplier**: Your work on AI and agentic systems is your highest leverage activity. Continue to prioritize and protect this time.
- **Health is the Foundation**: Inconsistent health and spiritual practices are the biggest threat to your productivity and well-being. The key is to build small, consistent habits.
- **Documentation Debt**: The lack of progress on NRE and NOCturnal documentation is a growing risk. It's crucial to start chipping away at this.
