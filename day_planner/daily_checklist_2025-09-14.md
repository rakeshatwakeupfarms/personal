# Sunday Checklist ✔️

## Review for Saturday, September 13th

Yesterday was a strong day for your Health and Spiritual goals, with significant progress on previously missed compulsory tasks. You successfully completed your self-energization exercise, bath and prayer, and meditation. You also made good progress on your AI assistant and planned a YouTube video on agentic AI.

However, you missed your 15k steps goal (achieved 9k), and other health habits like checking fasting glucose, prepping high-fiber lunch/snacks, and tracking water intake were not completed. Personal finance tasks were also missed.

## Huberman Routine Adherence & Suggestions

- **Morning Sunlight Exposure**: Not explicitly mentioned, but getting up late might have impacted this.
- **Hydration upon waking**: Not explicitly mentioned as completed.
- **Delay Caffeine**: Not explicitly mentioned.
- **Movement**: You are planning a long walk for 15k steps, which is good.
- **NSDR/Meditation**: Successfully completed meditation (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm).
- **Evening Light Exposure**: Not explicitly mentioned yet.

## Suggested 1-Hour Task for Today (Sunday, September 14th)

Based on your progress and goals, I suggest the following 1-hour task:

**"Draft a LinkedIn Article on Agentic AI"**

This task aligns with your monthly goal to "Write agentic workflows for retry" and your daily goal to "Draft a LinkedIn Article". It also builds on your recent success in planning a YouTube video on the same topic, allowing you to leverage your current momentum and knowledge. This will help you build your personal brand and reputation as an expert in the field.
